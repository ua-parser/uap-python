# Precompiled ruleset for [ua-parser](https://pypi.org/project/ua-parser/)

This project does not do anything on its own, nor does it have any
actual API: it contains the dataset of
[uap-core](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) pre-compiled for use
by [ua-parser](https://pypi.org/project/ua-parser/) to decrease
initialisation times.
